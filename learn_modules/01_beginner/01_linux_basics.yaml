    title: "Welcome to Linux!"
    notes: |
      🐧 Welcome to the Linux Learning Path!
      
      Linux is an open-source operating system that powers:
      • Servers (90% of web servers)
      • Smartphones (Android)
      • Supercomputers (100% of top 500)
      • IoT devices
      • And much more!
      
      Key Concepts:
      ─────────────
      • Kernel - The core of the OS that manages hardware
      • Shell - The command-line interface (CLI) you'll use
      • Distribution - Different "flavors" of Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
      
      Why Learn Linux?
      ────────────────
      ✓ Essential for DevOps, Cloud, and System Administration
      ✓ Powers most servers and cloud infrastructure
      ✓ Free and open-source
      ✓ Highly customizable and powerful
      
      Let's get started with your first commands!
    
    exercises:
      - id: ex_01
        type: command
        description: "Find out where you are in the filesystem"
        command: pwd
        expected_pattern: "^/"
        hints:
          - "Type: pwd"
          - "pwd stands for 'print working directory'"
          - "Just type the three letters: p-w-d"

      - id: ex_02
        type: command
        description: "List the files in your current directory"
        command: ls
        hints:
          - "Type: ls"
          - "ls stands for 'list'"

    title: "Understanding the Filesystem"
    notes: |
      📁 Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
      
      Linux organizes files in a tree structure starting from / (root):
      
      /
      ├── home/     ← User home directories
      ├── etc/      ← Configuration files
      ├── var/      ← Variable data (logs, temp files)
      ├── usr/      ← User programs and data
      ├── bin/      ← Essential command binaries
      └── tmp/      ← Temporary files
      
      Important Concepts:
      ──────────────────
      • Everything is a file (even devices!)
      • Paths can be absolute (/home/user) or relative (../folder)
      • ~ represents your home directory
      • . represents current directory
      • .. represents parent directory
      
      Let's practice navigating!
    
    exercises:
      - id: ex_03
        type: command
        description: "Go to your home directory"
        command: cd ~
        validation:
          type: command
          command: "pwd | grep -E '/home/|/root'"
        hints:
          - "Type: cd ~"
          - "The ~ symbol is a shortcut for your home directory"
        points: 10
      
      - id: ex_04
        type: command
        description: "List files including hidden ones"
        command: ls -a
        expected_pattern: "\\."
        hints:
          - "Use the -a flag with ls"
          - "Type: ls -a"
          - "The -a flag shows 'all' files, including hidden ones that start with ."

    title: "Getting Help"
    notes: |
      📚 How to Learn Any Command
      
      Linux has built-in documentation! You never need to memorize everything.
      
      Three ways to get help:
      ──────────────────────
      1. man <command>    - Full manual page
      2. <command> --help - Quick help summary
      3. whatis <command> - One-line description
      
      Examples:
      • man ls      - Full documentation for ls
      • ls --help   - Quick help for ls
      • whatis pwd  - Short description of pwd
      
      Navigation in man pages:
      • Space - Next page
      • b - Previous page
      • / - Search
      • q - Quit
      
      Pro tip: You can search man pages with: man -k <keyword>
    
    exercises:
      - id: ex_05
        type: command
        description: "Get a quick description of the 'ls' command"
        command: whatis ls
        expected_pattern: "list"
        hints:
          - "Type: whatis ls"
          - "whatis gives you a one-line description"
        points: 10
      
      - id: ex_06
        type: question
        question: "What does the 'cd' command do?"
        options:
          - "Copy directory"
          - "Change directory"
          - "Create directory"
          - "Clear display"
        correct_answer: "Change directory"

    title: "Basic File Operations"
    notes: |
      📝 Working with Files
      
      Essential file commands:
      ───────────────────────
      • touch <file>  - Create empty file
      • cat <file>    - Display file contents
      • cp <src> <dst> - Copy file
      • mv <src> <dst> - Move/rename file
      • rm <file>     - Remove file
      
      Safety Tips:
      ───────────
      ⚠️  rm is permanent - there's no trash/recycle bin!
      ✓  Use rm -i for interactive confirmation
      ✓  Be careful with wildcards (*)
      
      Let's practice safely!
    
    exercises:
      - id: ex_07
        type: command
        description: "Create a new empty file called 'test.txt'"
        command: touch test.txt
        validation:
          type: file
          path: "test.txt"
        hints:
          - "Use the touch command"
          - "Type: touch test.txt"
        points: 15
      
      - id: ex_08
        type: command
        description: "List files to verify test.txt was created"
        command: ls
        expected_pattern: "test\\.txt"
        hints:
          - "Use ls to list files"
          - "You should see test.txt in the output"
