  Find the MAC address of the first network interface (excluding loopback) and save it to /tmp/{{ random_file }}.

points: 15
time_limit: 300

setup_commands:
  - "rm -f /tmp/{{ random_file }} 2>/dev/null || true"

validation:
  checks:
    - type: file
      path: "/tmp/{{ random_file }}"
      should_exist: true

    - type: command
      command: "grep -E '([0-9a-fA-F]{2}:){5}[0-9a-fA-F]{2}' /tmp/{{ random_file }}"
      regex_match: "([0-9a-fA-F]{2}:){5}[0-9a-fA-F]{2}"

hints:
  - "Use 'ip link show' or 'ifconfig' to see network interfaces"
  - "Look for 'link/ether' or 'HWaddr' in the output"
  - "Use grep to filter the MAC address"
