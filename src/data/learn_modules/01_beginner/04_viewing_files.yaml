      👀 Reading File Contents
      
      Commands for viewing files:
      ─────────────────────────
      • cat file       - Display entire file
      • less file      - View file page by page
      • more file      - Similar to less (older)
      • head file      - Show first 10 lines
      • tail file      - Show last 10 lines
      • head -n 5 file - Show first 5 lines
      • tail -n 20 file - Show last 20 lines
      
      When to use each:
      • cat - Small files, quick view
      • less - Large files, need to scroll
      • head - Check beginning of file
      • tail - Check end of file (logs!)
